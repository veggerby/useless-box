## UselessBoxController Behavior Overview

### 1. Initial Setup and Idle State

* **When the program starts**, the controller initializes the box components, including the switch arm, lid arm, proximity sensor, toggle switch, and LED.
* The system enters the **IDLE** state initially, waiting for any user interaction (such as the proximity of a hand or the toggle switch being activated).

### 2. Monitoring and Responding to Proximity and Switch State

* The `update()` method continuously monitors the proximity sensor and the state of the toggle switch.
* The box reacts based on proximity levels (`VERY_CLOSE`, `CLOSE`, or `FAR`) and the toggle switch state (`On` or `Off`). Here's how each condition is handled:

### 3. Switch State Changes

* **If the toggle switch is turned on** (`current_switch` becomes `True`):
  * The system enters the `SWITCH_OFF` state.
  * The LED is turned **on** to signal the activation.
  * A **random delay** (shorter or longer, with more frequent short delays) is introduced before switching off the toggle.
  * The `_handle_switch_toggle()` method is called, which:
    * Opens the lid.
    * Attempts to switch off the toggle. If it fails, it retries up to three times.
    * Retracts the switch arm and closes the lid afterward.
  * The LED is turned **off** again, and the state resets to **IDLE**.

### 4. Proximity: Very Close Interaction

* **If a hand is detected very close** (`ProximityState.VERY_CLOSE`) and the box is in the `IDLE` state:
  * There is a **5% chance** of the box playing a **peek-a-boo** animation:
    * The lid opens slightly and then closes.
  * There is also a **20% chance** of the box threatening to turn off the toggle:
    * The switch arm moves to a halfway position as if threatening, then retracts.
  * If neither occurs, the box simply acknowledges the hand's presence but does nothing more.

* **If the lid is already open** when the hand is very close:
  * The box ensures the lid stays closed to prevent any tampering.
  * Occasionally, it might perform a **peek-a-boo** with a **1% probability**.
  * The LED blinks slowly when the hand is very close.

### 5. Proximity: Close Interaction

* **If a hand is detected close** (`ProximityState.CLOSE`) and the box is in the `IDLE` state:
  * There is a **30% chance** the box will perform a **fake-out**:
    * The lid opens slightly and quickly closes.
  * Otherwise, it enters the `TEASING` state and performs a teasing animation:
    * The lid opens to a random angle (50% to 100%), pauses, and then closes.

### 6. Proximity: Far Interaction

* **If the hand moves away** (`ProximityState.FAR`) and the box is not in the `IDLE` state:
  * The box returns to the **IDLE** state.
  * The LED is turned **off**.
  * The lid is closed if it is open, and the switch arm is retracted.

### 7. Inactivity Timeout

* The box monitors the duration since the last interaction. If the time exceeds the set `inactivity_timeout` (5 seconds in this case):
  * If the lid is open (`LID_OPEN` state), the box closes the lid and retracts the switch arm to its default position.

### 8. Panic Mode

* **If the user toggles the switch repeatedly** (three times within three seconds):
  * The box enters **panic mode**, where it:
    * Rapidly opens and closes the lid while blinking the LED for five cycles.
  * The state returns to **IDLE** after the panic mode completes.

### 9. LED Behavior Based on Proximity

* The LED behavior is tied to proximity:
  * **Very Close**: LED blinks slowly (on for half a second, off for half a second).
  * **Close**: LED blinks rapidly (on for 0.1 seconds, off for 0.1 seconds).
  * **Far**: LED remains off.

### Summary

* The `UselessBoxController` reacts dynamically based on the proximity of a hand and the toggle switch state. It performs quirky behaviors like teasing, fake-outs, peek-a-boo, threatening gestures, and panic mode to entertain and surprise users.
* The randomness introduced (through probabilities and delays) ensures that the box feels unpredictable and playful, making interactions more engaging.
* The box also incorporates safety measures, such as ensuring the lid stays closed when the hand is too close and resetting states after inactivity, providing a consistent user experience.
